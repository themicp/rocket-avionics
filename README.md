# Rocket Avionics

Basic avionics system for use in rockets. Listens to data from altimeters and IMUs, logs them and uses them to detect the apogee of the rocket and deploy recovery hardware.

Designed to be extensible and support any altimeter or IMU.

Tested on Arduino UNO R3 and Adafruit Feather M0.
